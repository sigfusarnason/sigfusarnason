👋 Hi, I’m @sigfusarnason (Sigfús Árnason) 
I am a Business Analytics Master's student at Fordham University's Gabelli School of Business. 
Having graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics from Yale University, I wanted a more application-based, hands-on way of studying data.
I am learning a plethora of different programming languages and data modeling techniques which I hope to display here on my GitHub page.

I am reachable through my LinkedIn page: www.linkedin.com/in/sigfus-arnason
